### 2. Service Layer (`services/auth.service.js`)
- ✅ `forgotPassword(email)` - Generates token, sends email, stores in DB
- ✅ `resetPassword(token, password)` - Validates token, updates password
- ✅ Fixed nodemailer typo (`createTransport` instead of `createTransporter`)

### 3. Controller Layer (`controllers/auth.controller.js`)
- ✅ `forgotPassword(req, res)` - Handles forgot password requests
- ✅ `resetPassword(req, res)` - Handles password reset requests
- ✅ Added password validation (minimum 8 characters)

### 4. Routes (`routes/auth.routes.js`)
- ✅ `POST /auth/forgot-password` - Request password reset
- ✅ `POST /auth/reset-password` - Reset password with token
- ✅ Complete Swagger documentation

### 5. Security Features
- ✅ 24-hour token expiration
- ✅ One-time use tokens (cleared after reset)
- ✅ Password strength validation
- ✅ Email security (doesn't reveal if email exists)
- ✅ Multiple token validation layers
- ✅ JWT-based secure tokens

### 6. Email Integration
